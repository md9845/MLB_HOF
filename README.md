Predictor for Major League Baseball Hall of Fame

The Baseball Hall of Fame (HOF) recognizes and honors those who have achieved a level of excellence in the sport as a player, manager, executive or pioneer. The first election for induction into the HOF was held in 1936. The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, NY opened in 1939. The specific requirements for eligibility and voting process have changed several times in the years since, but currently are:
Eligibility

    Players must have played in at least 10 seasons
    Some of the 10 seasons must have been in a period between 5 and 15 years prior to the election
    Players must have ceased playing at least five years prior to the election
    In the event of death, a player is eligible for election prior to 5 years after his final game, provided other requirements are met.
    Players on Baseball's ineligible list are not to be considered for election


Election Process

    The Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA) Screening Committee prepares a ballot that includes a) votes on at least 5% of ballots in the previous election or b) eligible for the first time and nominated by at least two of the six members of the committee
    BBWAA members vote for candidates on the ballot. No elector may vote for more than 10 players in an election. Players must be included on 75% of ballots cast to be elected into the HOF
    A player may remain on the ballot for a maximum of ten years. If a player is not elected in 10 years, their name is removed from the BBWAA ballot.
    Players that are no longer eligible for the BBWAA ballot may still be considered by the Era Committees, each focused on a specific period of baseball history. Committees meet on a rotating basis every five or ten years, so that one or two committees is involved in the election in any given year.

Using data from the Lahman database http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/ and baseballreference.com https://www.baseball-reference.com/data/ through the 2019 season, we will attempt to predict which players will be inducted to the HOF.

For our purposes, only Major League Baseball players are included. Negro League players or off-field personnel are not included in the models.
